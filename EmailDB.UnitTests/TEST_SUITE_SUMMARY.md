- Large volume handling

#### AppendOnlyVsZoneTreeTest
- Performance comparison between storage approaches
- Efficiency analysis

## Key Test Patterns

### Robust Test Design
1. **Deterministic**: Uses fixed seeds for random operations
2. **Isolated**: Each test creates its own temporary directory
3. **Comprehensive**: Tests both success and failure scenarios
4. **Measurable**: Captures performance metrics and efficiency

### Common Assertions
- Storage efficiency > 80%
- Write performance < 50ms average
- Read performance < 10ms average
- Error rates < 1%
- Memory growth < 2x baseline
- Recovery rate > 50% from corruption

### Test Data Patterns
- Realistic email sizes with distribution
- Special characters and Unicode support
- Concurrent access patterns
- Progressive load testing
- Edge case boundary testing

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Execution
